Python script to rename anime video files to look cleaner.

There are several scripts in this project

python AnimeFormatter.py [Directory with video files]
python AnimeMover.py
python FormatDirectory [Directory with directories to call AnimeFormatter.py on]
FormatUndo.py [Directory to undo changes on] (Still a work in progress)

Then just follow the in terminal instructions

This script only works with certain formats that I've tested, so feel free to modify the code to suit your own needs, and for any edge cases that you may come across. If you want you can email me at alvjou@gmail.com with your changes!
